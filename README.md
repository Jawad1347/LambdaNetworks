# LambdaNetworks
![Python tests](https://github.com/g0lemXIV/LambdaNetworks/workflows/Python%20tests/badge.svg?branch=main) ![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/ansicolortags.svg)

Tensorflow implementation of [Lambda Network](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xTJEN-ggl1b) framework for capturing long-range interaction between input and structured information.

Paper review: [Yannic Kilcher's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qxJ2WD8p4w)
Pytorch implementation (I was based on): [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains/lambda-networks)  

*However, I will implement 1D convolution lambda and lambda dense here, soon...*

## Installation  
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd LambdaNetworks
pip install .
```

## Examples of usage

soon...
